Created using Thomas Palef's tutorial on <a href="http://www.lessmilk.com/tutorial/flappy-bird-phaser-1">How to Make Flappy Bird in HTML5 with Phaser</a>. The default assets feature a special appearance from a friend as the flying bird and his aversion to cats as the obstacles.

You can upload your own assets to replace the bird and the obstacles.
