I graduated from my undergraduate studies at the head of a pandemic and I guess I'll be graduating from my graduate studies at the tail end of it!

I studied history and software engineering at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/">McGill University</a> and am now currently pursuing graduate studies in computer science at the <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/">University of British Columbia</a>.
